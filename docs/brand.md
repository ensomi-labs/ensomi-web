# ensomi brand

ensomi turns music from something you listen to into something you take part in.

## Name and statement

- Brand: **ensomi**, always lowercase, also at the start of a sentence. Japanese: **えんそみ**.
- A coined name from 演奏 (*ensō*, performance), with 円相 (*ensō*, an open circular gesture) as a secondary association.
- Statement: **ensomi — Play the music around you.**
- 日本語: **えんそみ — 聴く音楽から、参加する音楽へ。**
- The statement and its Japanese line appear unchanged on every language's page, the English line included.

Release and model names keep their own form where they are data, for example the runtime's `model_name` "Ensomi R2"; page copy says "R2" or "ensomi R2".

## Principles

- **Participation over consumption.** Copy invites the reader to do something with music, not to watch a product.
- **Softness with expressive motion.** Rounded shapes and calm surfaces; motion and the warm accent mark what moves or acts.
- **An open, asymmetric circle, never a closed ring.** The mark is two asymmetric arcs, lavender and rose, overlapping near the top into purple, around an irregular almond-shaped opening, on dark plum with a diagonal division. Flat 2D, rounded, saturated.

## Palette

One theme: dark plum. Tokens live in `public/styles.css`.

| Role | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ground | `#1c1525` | page background |
| Ground, second half | `#231a2e` | the diagonal split behind the hero |
| Surface | `#2a2036`, `#342944` | panels, fields |
| Text | `#f6f1fb` | body text |
| Muted text | `#c7bcd6` | secondary text |
| Lavender | `#B5B3EF` | links, outline buttons, long notes in the player |
| Rose | `#EAA0B7` | the Japanese statement, accents, taps in the player |
| Intersection purple | `#9562D7` | fills and borders only (step markers, requested-section bands); text on it or in it on the ground stays under 4.5:1 |
| Action and motion | `#F39AAF` → `#FF879F` → `#FF708F` | primary buttons, progress, the playhead and judgement line; nothing else |
| Ink on action | `#2b0f1e` | text on the action gradient and on selected presets |

All text pairs meet WCAG AA on the ground and surfaces (muted text on the raised surface is the lowest at 7.5:1; ink on `#FF708F` is 6.7:1). Field borders (`#8f7dab`) reach 3:1 against the field.

## Shape and type

- Generous type with a rounded face where the system has one (SF Pro Rounded, Hiragino Maru Gothic, M PLUS Rounded 1c), system UI text elsewhere.
- Soft corners with one tighter corner (`26px 26px 26px 10px`) for panels and cards; pills for buttons and presets.

## What to avoid

- Literal music decoration outside the functional player: notes, waveforms, piano keys, rhythm-game imagery.
- The look of an AI infrastructure company: neon grids, terminal aesthetics, glowing gradients as decoration.
- Closing the circle in any motif.

## Voice

Frontier, exploratory, innovative and open, and still warm and exact. On ensomi.app, lead with the ambition: what we are building and why it is exciting, without defensive wording. Name future work as what we are building, never as what already exists, and keep a limit on the page only where it changes what someone does with the tool, such as the star-rating note and the run instructions. The GitHub profile and the reports carry status, limits and conditions, and what they say about a release follows its report.
