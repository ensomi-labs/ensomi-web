# Ensomi browser checks

Run from `packages/runtime` with Homebrew Node on PATH. These tests do not edit product code. They create evidence in `artifacts/browser-test/`; binaries, downloads, per-frame data, and large logs are confined to its `bulk/` directory. Chrome runs headless; `ENSOMI_HEADED=1` opens windows.

```sh
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
npm run build:site
npm run typecheck:site
npm run serve:site -- 8087 ../ensomi-model/artifacts/release-r2/bulk/hf/ensomi-r2   # npm runs scripts in the repository root
```

In a second terminal, from `packages/runtime`:

Prerequisites: `npm ci` in the repository root, installed Google Chrome, the sibling `ensomi-model` repository with release model, four dataset songs, and runtime-reference recordings. `ENSOMI_MODEL_DIR` and `ENSOMI_TEST_URL` override the page test's model directory and URL. Keep timing runs sequential.

`page-matrix.mjs` uses the actual built page, file/directory inputs, and both download links. It observes worker messages without changing computation. Cold means a fresh browser context with an empty Cache API; warm means a reload of that context after all model assets have been used. An optional fourth argument selects one song, allowing Adventure to be the first generation in its session. Generations use seed 1; local runs of all songs also generate with a blank seed and check that the page shows the seed it drew, keeps the field blank, and gives the same chart again for the shown seed. `ENSOMI_PLAYER=1` measures note geometry against `HTMLAudioElement.currentTime`, frame cadence, rates, and seeks on the final Adventure result. Before the first play it checks the volume slider: the audio element starts at the slider's initial value over 100, follows the slider down by arrow key and by pointer, and stays at most 1 when pushed past the top; a failure fails the page test. Every load checks that the Exact timing option is off by default, read from the control. `ENSOMI_EXACT=1` turns it on after each load and adds `-exact` to the report and download names; every generation then needs an `Exact-timing decode` row in the times table and a Timing row in the receipt list, and without it either row fails the test. The memory sampler observes process RSS, not GPU allocation bytes.

`diagnostics.mts` starts an isolated server on an automatically allocated loopback port and bundles the production runtime into a test worker. `networks` runs one recorded call of each graph with verbose ORT logs and GPU profiling. `compare` runs every graph call in one Catch the Moment generation on WebGPU and WASM using identical feeds and aggregates absolute output differences. `replay` uses browser PCM and Python's recorded draws through `options.replay`; the core stops at the first draw whose name or choice differs from the recording, and the result reports that draw. The Wasm build has no trace hook, so grid positions are not compared. `control` repeats replay with the recorded Python PCM as a positive control: every hit object equal and every draw consumed. The runtime arranges a song once; where the release arranged it a second time, the recording's pass-2 draws are left out and the reference is the chart its pass-1 decisions make, as in ensomi-runtime's `js/checks/replay.mjs`. `native` repeats replay with the page's exact-timing decoding (`site/audio.ts`: the file's own rate, the core converts it). `pcm` compares native-rate and Mel PCM windows against the recordings to distinguish codec, resampling, and length changes.

`speed.sh <label> [repeats] [providers] [songs] [source]` builds the page, serves it on port 8087 with the release model and runs `page-matrix.mjs` once per song and provider (each song first in its session, so cold then warm), keeping every report under `artifacts/speed/runs/`; `speed-summary.mjs` prints load, wall and receipt phase seconds with the chart hash from such reports. `tests/browser/speed.sh after 2 "webgpu wasm" "adventure catch-the-moment"` is the inner loop; `hf` as the source times cold downloads from Hugging Face. `tests/browser/build-main.sh [commit]` builds the page with the TypeScript runtime (main `9d8e725`) into `artifacts/bulk/main`; `ENSOMI_SITE=artifacts/bulk/main/site tests/browser/speed.sh old ...` times that build on the same port.

`pcm-timing.sh` builds the page, serves it on port 8087 and runs `pcm-timing.mjs`: three rounds in which each of Adventure (96 kHz) and Catch the Moment (44.1 kHz) gets, with the Exact timing option off and then on, a reload and two warm WebGPU generations, seed 1, into `artifacts/browser-test/pcm-timing.json`. The times table's `Prepare PCM` is the core's rate conversion (the page prepares the song before Generate, so the receipt no longer times it); its `Exact-timing decode` is the second decode.

`prepare-play.mjs [webgpu|wasm]` checks that the page prepares a song's timing as soon as the model and the song are ready and sends no generation until Generate, that Generate and Generate again reuse it, and that a new result seeks to the first note's visual preview time (using the actual lanes canvas height and selected speed) when this skips at least 3 s, otherwise to 0. Regenerating while a result plays stops the audio at the new preview time and returns the button to Play. Exact timing prepares again at the song's rate, and Generate pressed before the timing is done waits for it. The test compares the Catch the Moment chart (star 3.5, seed 1) with `page-<backend>-local.json` when that report exists, into `prepare-play-<backend>.json`.

`ENSOMI_PLAYER=1 node tests/browser/page-matrix.mjs webgpu local` records a `previewStart` measurement after generation: it compares audio currentTime with the expected canvas-based preview start (within 50 ms), or 0 when the skipped intro would be under 3 s.

`grid-drift.mjs <label>` generates the four release songs through the served page (WebAssembly, seed 1) and compares each receipt's timing segments and beat grid with the Python release receipts in `ensomi-model/artifacts/runtime-ref`; `ENSOMI_EXACT=1` turns the Exact timing option on, and `ENSOMI_TEST_URL` points it at another build, such as main's on port 8088. `tail-screenshot.mjs <name>` replays wheel.mjs's Adventure result into the page and saves the inspector at its default speed around the long note closest before the next head in its lane, as `docs/screenshots/inspector-tail-<name>.png`.

`load-benchmark.mjs` serves the production page on an automatically allocated loopback port with a test-only worker bundle that times file reads and `InferenceSession.create`. It preserves the production caching and loading code. Its generated instrumented bundle lives only under artifacts. `fallback.mjs` injects missing-adapter and device-failure conditions into an isolated worker response. `wheel.mjs` replays a previously generated Adventure result into the actual page UI to isolate wheel event delivery from inference. `mobile.mjs` uses Chrome device emulation, not a real iOS/Android browser. `hero-contrast.mjs` and `hero-contrast.py` additionally compare the actual SVG backdrop behind solid text pixels; computed ancestor backgrounds alone miss this overlap. The extended player fixture run exercises all three rates for 60 seconds each. `validate-downloads.py` independently checks ZIP CRCs and parses exported hit objects. `../../artifacts/browser-test/report.md` is written from these runs.
