# Ensomi browser checks

Run from `packages/runtime` with Homebrew Node on PATH. These tests do not edit product code. They create evidence in `artifacts/browser-test/`; binaries, downloads, per-frame data, and large logs are confined to its `bulk/` directory. Chrome runs headless; `ENSOMI_HEADED=1` opens windows.

```sh
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH
npm run build:site
npm run typecheck:site
npm run serve:site -- 8087 ../ensomi-model/artifacts/release-r2/bulk/hf/ensomi-r2   # npm runs scripts in the repository root
```

In a second terminal, from `packages/runtime`:

Prerequisites: `npm ci` in the repository root, installed Google Chrome, the sibling `ensomi-model` repository with release model, four dataset songs, and runtime-reference recordings. `ENSOMI_MODEL_DIR` and `ENSOMI_TEST_URL` override the page test's model directory and URL. Keep timing runs sequential.

`page-matrix.mjs` uses the actual built page, file/directory inputs, and both download links. It observes worker messages without changing computation. Cold means a fresh browser context with an empty Cache API; warm means a reload of that context after all model assets have been used. An optional fourth argument selects one song, allowing Adventure to be the first generation in its session. Generations use seed 1; local runs of all songs also generate with seed 0 and check that the page shows the nonzero seed it drew, keeps the field at 0, and gives the same chart again for the shown seed. `ENSOMI_PLAYER=1` measures note geometry against the time being heard (`HTMLAudioElement.currentTime` less the `baseLatency` and `outputLatency` the page's AudioContext reports, times the rate), frame cadence, rates, and seeks on the final Adventure result. Before the first play it checks the volume slider: the audio element starts at the slider's initial value over 100, follows the slider down by arrow key and by pointer, and stays at most 1 when pushed past the top. At the first play it checks the routing: one AudioContext, the element through one MediaElementAudioSourceNode and a GainNode to the destination, the gain at the slider's value over 100 (set below the default before the play, then moved down and past the top while playing; at most 1) and the element's volume at 1, and at the end still one context and one source. With the latency getters overridden, once to an injected 200 ms and once to return undefined, at rates 1, 0.5 and 1.5, it plays from 30 s, seeks to mid-song on the overview, and checks that the drawing is at the later of the play's or seek's start and the audio clock less latency times rate within one frame, holds at each start, never steps back and matches the clock text. A failure of the volume, routing or latency checks fails the page test. Every load checks that the Exact timing option is off by default, read from the control. `ENSOMI_EXACT=1` turns it on after each load and adds `-exact` to the report and download names; every generation then needs a receipt `pcm` stage above 0 and a Timing row in the receipt list, and without it a Timing row fails the test. The memory sampler observes process RSS, not GPU allocation bytes.

`diagnostics.mts` starts an isolated server on an automatically allocated loopback port and bundles the production runtime into a test worker. `networks` runs one recorded call of each graph with verbose ORT logs and GPU profiling. `compare` runs every graph call in one Catch the Moment generation on WebGPU and WASM using identical feeds and aggregates absolute output differences. `replay` uses browser PCM and Python's recorded draws through `options.replay`; the core stops at the first draw whose name or choice differs from the recording, and the result reports that draw. The Wasm build has no trace hook, so grid positions are not compared. `control` repeats replay with the recorded Python PCM as a positive control: every hit object equal and every draw consumed. `native` repeats replay with the page's exact-timing decoding (`site/audio.ts`: the file's own rate, the core converts it). `pcm` compares native-rate and Mel PCM windows against the recordings to distinguish codec, resampling, and length changes.

`speed.sh <label> [repeats] [providers] [songs] [source]` builds the page, serves it on port 8087 with the release model and runs `page-matrix.mjs` once per song and provider (each song first in its session, so cold then warm), keeping every report under `artifacts/speed/runs/`; `speed-summary.mjs` prints load, wall and receipt phase seconds with the chart hash from such reports. `tests/browser/speed.sh after 2 "webgpu wasm" "adventure catch-the-moment"` is the inner loop; `hf` as the source times cold downloads from Hugging Face. `tests/browser/build-main.sh [commit]` builds the page with the TypeScript runtime (main `9d8e725`) into `artifacts/bulk/main`; `ENSOMI_SITE=artifacts/bulk/main/site tests/browser/speed.sh old ...` times that build on the same port.

`pcm-timing.sh` builds the page, serves it on port 8087 and runs `pcm-timing.mjs`: three rounds in which each of Adventure (96 kHz) and Catch the Moment (44.1 kHz) gets, with the Exact timing option off and then on, a reload and two warm WebGPU generations, seed 1, into `artifacts/browser-test/pcm-timing.json`. The receipt's `pcm` stage is the core's rate conversion; the times table's `Exact-timing decode` is the second decode.

`grid-drift.mjs <label>` generates the four release songs through the served page (WebAssembly, seed 1) and compares each receipt's timing segments and beat grid with the Python release receipts in `ensomi-model/artifacts/runtime-ref`; `ENSOMI_EXACT=1` turns the Exact timing option on, and `ENSOMI_TEST_URL` points it at another build, such as main's on port 8088. `tail-screenshot.mjs <name>` replays wheel.mjs's Adventure result into the page and saves the inspector at its default speed around the long note closest before the next head in its lane, as `docs/screenshots/inspector-tail-<name>.png`.

`load-benchmark.mjs` serves the production page on an automatically allocated loopback port with a test-only worker bundle that times file reads and `InferenceSession.create`. It preserves the production caching and loading code. Its generated instrumented bundle lives only under artifacts. `fallback.mjs` injects missing-adapter and device-failure conditions into an isolated worker response. `wheel.mjs` replays a previously generated Adventure result into the actual page UI to isolate wheel event delivery from inference. `mobile.mjs` uses Chrome device emulation, not a real iOS/Android browser. `hero-contrast.mjs` and `hero-contrast.py` additionally compare the actual SVG backdrop behind solid text pixels; computed ancestor backgrounds alone miss this overlap. The extended player fixture run exercises all three rates for 60 seconds each. `validate-downloads.py` independently checks ZIP CRCs and parses exported hit objects. `../../artifacts/browser-test/report.md` is written from these runs.
